  abstract	= {Abstract Plant traits – the morphological, anatomical,
		  physiological, biochemical and phenological characteristics
		  of plants and their organs – determine how primary
		  producers respond to environmental factors, affect other
		  trophic levels, influence ecosystem processes and services
		  and provide a link from species richness to ecosystem
		  functional diversity. Trait data thus represent the raw
		  material for a wide range of research from evolutionary
		  biology, community and functional ecology to biogeography.
		  Here we present the global database initiative named TRY,
		  which has united a wide range of the plant trait research
		  community worldwide and gained an unprecedented buy-in of
		  trait data: so far 93 trait databases have been
		  contributed. The data repository currently contains almost
		  three million trait entries for 69 000 out of the world's
		  300 000 plant species, with a focus on 52 groups of
		  traits characterizing the vegetative and regeneration
		  stages of the plant life cycle, including growth,
		  dispersal, establishment and persistence. A first data
		  analysis shows that most plant traits are approximately
		  log-normally distributed, with widely differing ranges of
		  variation across traits. Most trait variation is between
		  species (interspecific), but significant intraspecific
		  variation is also documented, up to 40\% of the overall
		  variation. Plant functional types (PFTs), as commonly used
		  in vegetation models, capture a substantial fraction of the
		  observed variation – but for several traits most
		  variation occurs within PFTs, up to 75\% of the overall
		  variation. In the context of vegetation models these traits
		  would better be represented by state variables rather than
		  fixed parameter values. The improved availability of plant
		  trait data in the unified global database is expected to
		  support a paradigm shift from species to trait-based
		  ecology, offer new opportunities for synthetic plant trait
		  research and enable a more realistic and empirically
		  grounded representation of terrestrial vegetation in Earth
		  system models.}
